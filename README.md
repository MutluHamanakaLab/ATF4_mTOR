# Summary
We investigated the effects of ATF4 and mTOR on gene expression in human lung fibroblasts using RNA-sequencing. We found both ATF4 and mTOR regulate expression of genes that are involved in controlling amino acid synthesis and transportation. mTOR additionally regulates genes that are involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.
